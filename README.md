OpenVirteX for OpenFlow 1.3
==========
OVX is a network hypervisor that can create multiple virtual and programmable networks on top of a single physical infrastructure. Each tenant can use the full addressing space, specify their own topology, and deploy the network OS of their choice. Networks can be reconfigured at run-time, and OVX can automatically recover from physical failures.

Currently, OVX is maintained by Operating Systems Lab, Korea University led by Prof. Chuck Yoo.

Our team has released OpenVirteX which supports OpenFlow 1.3, which can be found in this branch.

The initial OVX for OpenFlow 1.0 is in master branch.
