OVX is a network hypervisor that can create multiple virtual and programmable networks on top of a single physical infrastructure. Each tenant can use the full addressing space, specify their own topology, and deploy the network OS of their choice. Networks can be reconfigured at run-time, and OVX can automatically recover from physical failures.

Our team has released OpenVirteX which supports OpenFlow 1.3 as Libera (default mode), which can be found in this branch.

The initial OVX for OpenFlow 1.0 is in master branch.
